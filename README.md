## Overview

Refugees in the Philippines have a long and diverse history, with the country serving as a sanctuary for individuals and communities fleeing persecution and conflict. From hosting Vietnamese boat people and Cambodian refugees in the past to providing shelter for those displaced by internal conflicts, the Philippines has played a role in supporting those seeking refuge.

## Business Problem

This study aims to answer the following questions:

1. From which countries has Philippines admitted the highest number of refugees?
2. What are the total number of resettled refugees in Philippines per year?
3. What are the countries of origin for the majority of asylum claims made in Philippines?
4. What is the total number of asylum claims made in Philippines every year?
5. What are the general trends in refugee and asylum statistics from 2017-2022?

## Data

"Asylum" and "refugee" are related concepts, but they differ in their legal and contextual definitions:

1. **Refugee:**
   - A refugee is a person who has fled their home country because of well-founded fears of persecution based on factors like race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.
   - Refugees often seek protection in another country due to these fears.
   - They may apply for refugee status, and if granted, they are recognized as refugees and receive legal protections and assistance in the host country.

2. **Asylum:**
   - Asylum refers to the protection or status granted to refugees when they apply for it in another country.
   - When a refugee arrives in another country and formally requests asylum, they are seeking legal recognition and the right to live and work in that country without the fear of being deported.
   - The host country evaluates their case to determine if they meet the criteria for refugee status, and if approved, they are granted asylum.

In summary, a refugee is someone who flees their home country due to persecution, while asylum is the legal protection and status granted to a refugee when they apply for it in another country. Asylum provides refugees with a legal framework to live and work in the host country and enjoy protection from being forcibly returned to their home country.
